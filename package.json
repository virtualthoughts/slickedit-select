The benefit of\nthis is that column select is no longer a two handed operation.\n\nTo work around an issue on linux where the contextMenu event is triggered on a mouseDown rather than mouseUp, I needed to suppress the contextMenu event, and then reissue it with a call to:\n\natom.contextMenu.showForEvent(e)\n\nThis has now been tested to work under both Windows and Linux, but I have no Mac available to test with.\n",
